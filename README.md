# LearnGate

**#OVERVIEW#**

The goal of the project is to develop a fully functional Online Learning Platform
that provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for students, admins,
and instructors. The platform allows students to easily browse, enroll in, and
access courses, while also enabling them to interact with course materials and
resources. Admins can efficiently manage the platform by adding and
organizing courses, updating content, and overseeing student enrollments.
Additionally, the platform includes a secure payment gateway to handle course
payments smoothly and securely. The primary objective is to create an
accessible, organized, and efficient online learning environment that simplifies
course management and enhances the overall educational experience for both
students and admins.
